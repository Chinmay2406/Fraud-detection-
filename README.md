# Fraud Detection Project

This project is a Fraud Detection system developed in Python. It runs in a custom Anaconda environment named `fraud`, and the application is built using **Streamlit** to create an interactive web interface.(deployed)

## Project Structure

- `app.py`: Main file to run the Streamlit app.
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python packages to install in the environment.
- `models/`: Directory containing trained models.
- `data/`: Directory containing datasets used for training and testing.
- `scripts/`: Folder containing additional scripts for data processing and model building.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have **Anaconda** installed on your system. You can download it from [here](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution).

### Setting up the Environment

1. Open **Anaconda Prompt**.
2. Navigate to the project directory using the following command:
    ```bash
    cd C:\Users\Fraud Detection
    ```
3. Create and activate the environment for the project. If the environment already exists, simply activate it:
    ```bash
    conda activate fraud
    ```

### Installing Dependencies

To ensure you have all the required packages, you can install the necessary dependencies by running:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Required Packages
The following packages are typically required for this project (add or modify according to your actual requirements):

streamlit: For creating the web application interface.
pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
numpy: For numerical operations.
scikit-learn: For machine learning models and preprocessing.
matplotlib: For data visualization.
seaborn: For statistical data visualization.
joblib: For saving and loading models.
pyod: For outlier detection.
You can add more packages as needed for your specific implementation.

Running the App
To start the Streamlit app, use the following command in the Anaconda prompt:
streamlit run app.py
This will open the Streamlit application in your web browser.

Usage
Once the app is running, you can interact with it through the browser interface. It allows you to input various parameters and receive real-time fraud detection predictions based on your input.

Features
Real-Time Predictions: Get instant predictions on whether a transaction is fraudulent or legitimate.
Data Visualization: Visualize trends and patterns in the data using graphs and charts.
Model Training: Optionally train models on new datasets.
Example Input
Provide some example inputs that the user can enter to see how the application responds.

Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues with package installations, make sure your conda environment is properly activated.
If the app does not open in the browser, check the Anaconda prompt for any error messages.

### Additional Suggestions:
1. **Add a License File**: Include a `LICENSE` file in your repository that outlines how others can use your code.
2. **Document Dataset Sources**: If you're using external datasets, provide information about where to find them and how to access them.
3. **Add Screenshots**: Include screenshots of your app in action to give users a visual understanding of what to expect.
4. **Deployment Instructions**: If applicable, add instructions for deploying the app on cloud services like Heroku or Streamlit Sharing.
5. **Contact Information**: Consider adding an email or contact form for users to reach out with questions or feedback.
